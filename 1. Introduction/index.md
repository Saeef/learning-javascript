# About JavaScript

JavaScript is a lightweight, interpreted, object-oriented language with first-class functions. It is a prototype-based,  that is dynamic, and supports object-oriented, imperative, and functional programming styles.

JavaScript was developed by Netscape as a means of bringing interaction to static web pages. Developed under the name Mocha, and later LiveScript, it was released as part of Netscape Navigator 2 in 1995.

Whilst JavaScript has a similar syntax to Java and shares part of its name, the two languages are not related. JavaScript is an interpreted language meaning it most commonly runs in a web browser and executed as step-by-step commands, whilst Java is a compiled language which must be converted to machine code for execution. 

In 1996, Netscape submitted JavaScript to Ecma International to create a specification. The result was ECMAScript in 1997. Other implementations include the now largely unused ActionScript.

Originally seen as a language for 'amateurs', JavaScript gained popularity with the rise of Ajax applications which allowed developers to return information asynchronously from a server, creating rich application. Since then, it has grown to one of the most popular languages on the web with numerous implementations and libraries.

The best way to get started with learning JavaScript is to create a simple development environment of just a single web page. In section 2, we'll explore this and interacting with the DOM (Document Object Model, or a webpage).
