# Learning JavaScript

This repository contains a number of reading materials, coding tests, and practical examples of some of the core principles of JavaScript.

It is aimed at those with little to no understanding of the language, and will walk you through it's patterns and quirks.

JavaScript is much maligned, and often criticised for not being a 'real' language based on some of these quirks but in recent years JavaScript has become one of the most widely used languages.

### Introduction
Covering the history of the development of JavaScript. A 101 for beginners.

See ```1. Introduction/index.md``` to begin.

### Working with the dom
An explanation of what the DOM is, and how to work with it to manipulate page behaviour. Useful for creating interactions on a web page.

See ```2. Working with the DOM/index.md``` to begin.

### Objects
Objects are incredibly important in JavaScript. This chapter goes into detail on why, and explains some of the notation and uses of objects in JavaScript.

See ```3. Objects/index.md``` to begin.

### Arrays
Array behaviour in JavaScript can differ from other, compiled languages. In this section those differences will be highlighted.

See ```4. Arrays/index.md``` to begin.

### Typing
JavaScript has loose typing, leading to some unexpected results and type coercion. These concepts and exceptions are explained in detail, including ways to limit these problems.

See ```5. Typing/index.md``` to begin.

### Functions
As an interpreted language, functions in JavaScript are incredibly important. This section also introduces the concept of closures and context shifting in JavaScript, and incredibly important feature.

See ```6. Functions/index.md``` to begin.

###Â Inheritance
Due to its prototypal nature, JavaScript handles Inheritance via a prototypal chain on objects. This can be leverages in different ways to create your applications.

See ```7. Inheritance/index.md``` to begin.

### Patterns
This section will detail a number of useful JavaScript patterns that will help shape applications and leverage some of the advantages of JavaScript. It will also detail the pros and cons of some of these patterns.

See ```8. Patterns/index.md``` to begin.

### Testing
JavaScript has a number of third-party libraries for Unit and End-to-End testing, all of which can help write TDD JavaScript.

See ```9. Testing/index.md``` to begin.

### ES6 and beyond
The original standard that JavaScript was developed on has grown and evolved with the evolution of ES5, ES6 and more. This section will explain those versions, as well as how they can be used to create more modern and maintainable JavaScript.

See ```10. ES6 and beyond/index.md``` to begin.

### Quiz
Test your knowledge with a multiple choice quiz, designed to put in practice the things you've learnt so far.

Open the html file ```11. Quiz/index.html``` to get started.

### Exercise
The summary of these learning materials is to complete 1 of 2 coding challenges. These tests will look to asses a number skills and challenge all the things you should have learnt so far, as well as looking for how you might structure a project. All the details and resources can be found in:

```12. Exercie/index.md```

Follow the instructions in the folder to complete and submit the test.
